## Surveillance
### Surveillance laws
Are there laws or legal provisions that allow the surveillance of communications – internet
and telephonic?
- Under what circumstances can surveillance take place?
- Do the laws make a distinction between communications content and metadata; if so, do
they have different provisions and so different levels of protection?
- Do the laws cover bulk interception?
Are there directives/orders from the executive (president, royalty, prime minister)
authorizing interception or access by law enforcement or authorized authorities? Under
what circumstances can these powers be used?
Are there are any bills that are currently being considered that would have an effect on
privacy and surveillance (for example, expanding the investigative powers of various
government agencies)?

### Surveillance actors
i. Intelligence/security agencies
What intelligence/security agencies are empowered by law to monitor communications?

Under which law(s) do they operate? What are the limitations to the communications they
can monitor?

Or do they operate outside the law?

ii. Law enforcement
What law enforcement agencies are empowered by the law to monitor communications?
For example, does this include the police, serious crime agenices, local/state police, tax
inspectors, local councils, anti-corruption agencies? Under which law(s) do they operate?

What are the limitations to the communications they can monitor?

### Surveillance capabilities
What do we know about the technical surveillance capabilities of the country? Ways of
answering this include looking at specific examples, eg what requests have come to light
for the quote/purchase/delivery of surveillance technologies? 

Have any cases emerged thatdisplay the technology capabilities?

### Surveillance oversight, checks and balances
Are there any checks and balances mentioned in the text of the laws? Namely:
- Is there a body or authority responsible for authorizing surveillance?
- Is there a reporting procedure that this body/authority must comply with?
- Is there a body or authority responsible for overseeing surveillance?
- Is there a reporting procedure that this body/authority must comply with?
- Are security agencies and/or service providers required to implement procedural
safeguards while implementing surveillance?

### Surveillance case law
Are there any interesting cases where courts have ruled on privacy, or cases pending
before a Court?

### Examples of surveillance
Are there any examples of surveillance that have come to light, either through the courts or
has been publically reported? Who reported it, who conducted the surveillance and do they
have a lawful authority to do so, who was/were the target(s), what was subject to
surveillance (devices - phones and computers, but also type of data: text, phone calls,
emails, etc.), what came out of it, if anything?
	
### Data protection laws
Are there laws/legal provisions addressing Data Protection? If yes, do these contain
provisions relating to access and disclosure of data to law enforcement or authorized
authorities?
Even if the country does not have a data protection law, that is also an important and
interesting point that should be referred to in this section. Is there a bill being discussed?
Any external actors involved (CNIL, EU, CoE of Convention 108)

### Accountability mechanisms
i. Habeas Data/subject access requests
 - Is there a law in the country that allows (specifically) a person affected to find out what

Access Request).

ii. Freedom of Information

government (eg. a Freedom of Information law)?
 - What are the 'exceptions' if any to this law (for example 'national security' or 'company
confidentiality’) that the government can cite to refuse to publish information?

## Sectoral initiatives
The purpose of this section is to explore in more detail the issues with regard to privacy and
data protection in areas that are relevant to life in the and emerging in each country. This
could be related to government schemes launched with lots of publicity; initiatives
introduced without broad public knowledge; schemes in the public or private sector; or de
facto examples in which privacy-related issues have emerged. Not all of these sectors will
be of relevance to every country, and so select which seem like relevant or important
issues. The level of detail we provide for each will vary as well as so we may want to
prioritise those more relevant/important now, and provide more details in the future.

For these sectors, it is most important to get across why these are relevant from a privacy
or data protection perspective. It may be important to understand:

a) the legal backdrop, or lack of, to a scheme

b) whether it is a private and/or public sector initiative; for public sector initiatives, which government agencies/bodies are involved, and for private sector, which companies are involved, and who is involved in the financing;

c) whether databases and information are stored locally or internationally; is information
held securely?

d) do the databases involved links with other sources of information, eg via a national ID
project

e) the extent to which it has been introduced - whether it's a national scheme, a pilot, oronly covers a limited sector of the population

f) whether there are concerns the scheme is discriminatory, or prejudicial, in how it is
deployed/used

### Cyber Security Policy
Does the country have a cyber security policy? Which government agency is developing it?

Are there any external actors involved (OAS, AU, EU, US?) What provisions does it contain?

Is it enforced?


### Cybercrime
Are there laws/legal provisions addressing cyber crimes? If yes, Under
which government ministry/agency does it fall (military, defence, law　enforcement?). 

Do these contain provisions allowing access and collection of data by law　enforcement/authorized authorities?

### Encryption
Are there limitations to what techniques people can lawfully use to
protect themselves? Eg is encryption regulated (need to register for use) or banned?

### Licensing of industry
What obligations are imposed on the telecommunication industry under　licensing agreements, these may include: modification of networks, providing direct access,enabling decryption of encrypted communications, etc.

### E-governance/digital agenda
Is the government promoting an "e-governance" agenda? This could include, for example,
making access to government information and services through an online portal.
- Does the egoverment programme hamper access for anyone who is not able to access
services online, for example making some services available ONLY through the
egovernment platform?
- Does the egovernment platform use SSL/HTTPS?
- Do these services require a unique identifier as a login (for example, a
national ID card number)? Is there an associated database that links the
user's access to services?
- Have any privacy concerns been raised over the egovernment programme?
- Are national data protection or privacy standards applicable to the government?

### Health sector + e-health
This is the use of databases and identity cards and how it ties to the health sector. What
new initiatives have been started, and what are planned, that gather data? How is data
stored and shared, and does it have an impact beyond that intended? For example, do
citizens need to be registered to access health care?
