# State of Privacy Briefing guidelines

### The constitution (if any)
What articles, if any, exist on privacy and/or data protection in the country’s constitution?

### Regional and International conventions
Is the country signatory to international treaties that recognise privacy as a fundamental
human right, including:

• Universal Declaration on Human Rights (Article 12)

## Surveillance
### Surveillance laws
Are there laws or legal provisions that allow the surveillance of communications – internet
and telephonic?
- Under what circumstances can surveillance take place?
- Do the laws make a distinction between communications content and metadata; if so, do
they have different provisions and so different levels of protection?
- Do the laws cover bulk interception?
Are there directives/orders from the executive (president, royalty, prime minister)
authorizing interception or access by law enforcement or authorized authorities? Under
what circumstances can these powers be used?
Are there are any bills that are currently being considered that would have an effect on
privacy and surveillance (for example, expanding the investigative powers of various
government agencies)?

### Surveillance actors
i. Intelligence/security agencies
What intelligence/security agencies are empowered by law to monitor communications?

Under which law(s) do they operate? What are the limitations to the communications they
can monitor?

Or do they operate outside the law?

ii. Law enforcement
What law enforcement agencies are empowered by the law to monitor communications?
For example, does this include the police, serious crime agenices, local/state police, tax
inspectors, local councils, anti-corruption agencies? Under which law(s) do they operate?

What are the limitations to the communications they can monitor?

### Surveillance capabilities
What do we know about the technical surveillance capabilities of the country? Ways of
answering this include looking at specific examples, eg what requests have come to light
for the quote/purchase/delivery of surveillance technologies? 

Have any cases emerged thatdisplay the technology capabilities?

### Surveillance oversight, checks and balances
Are there any checks and balances mentioned in the text of the laws? Namely:
- Is there a body or authority responsible for authorizing surveillance?
- Is there a reporting procedure that this body/authority must comply with?
- Is there a body or authority responsible for overseeing surveillance?
- Is there a reporting procedure that this body/authority must comply with?
- Are security agencies and/or service providers required to implement procedural
safeguards while implementing surveillance?

### Surveillance case law
Are there any interesting cases where courts have ruled on privacy, or cases pending
before a Court?

### Examples of surveillance
Are there any examples of surveillance that have come to light, either through the courts or
has been publically reported? Who reported it, who conducted the surveillance and do they
have a lawful authority to do so, who was/were the target(s), what was subject to
surveillance (devices - phones and computers, but also type of data: text, phone calls,
emails, etc.), what came out of it, if anything?
	
### Data protection laws
Are there laws/legal provisions addressing Data Protection? If yes, do these contain
provisions relating to access and disclosure of data to law enforcement or authorized
authorities?
Even if the country does not have a data protection law, that is also an important and
interesting point that should be referred to in this section. Is there a bill being discussed?
Any external actors involved (CNIL, EU, CoE of Convention 108)

### Accountability mechanisms
i. Habeas Data/subject access requests
 - Is there a law in the country that allows (specifically) a person affected to find out what
information is held about themselves? (This is sometimes called Habeus Data, or a Subject
Access Request).

ii. Freedom of Information
 - Are there any laws or processes by which ordinary citizens can obtain information from the
government (eg. a Freedom of Information law)?
 - What are the 'exceptions' if any to this law (for example 'national security' or 'company
confidentiality’) that the government can cite to refuse to publish information?

iii. Consumer protection rules
 - Does the country have consumer protection rules that cover data, for instance protecting consumer credit information?

iv. Data breaches: case law
 - Are there any interesting cases where courts have ruled on data protection? Or cases pending before a Court?
 - Are there any interesting cases that emerged from the work of the data protection authority, if there is one?

### Examples of data breaches
Are there any cases in which large amounts of personal data have been leaked to the
public? For example, hacks of government databases, or publication of personal data.

### Identification schemes
Note: a potential source for this section is the World Bank's Identification for Development
(ID4D) Global Dataset, which can be downloaded here: http://data.worldbank.org/data-
catalog/id4d-dataset

### ID cards and databases
Is there a national database or national ID card system in the country?

Within each of these databases:
• How many people are enrolled in it?

• When was it established?

• What kind of data does it collect?

• Which agency is responsible for managing it and storing it?

• What can you find out about the software and hardware that is used for it?

• Does it include a partnership with the private sector - national or international?

### Voter registration
Does your country have a biometric voter registration system?
 - What biometric data is recorded?
 - What company provides the technology? Where are voter cards produced? Where is the
database stored (nationally or internationally?)
 - Has the database been used for any other purposes? Are voter ID cards used in other
contexts, either officially or unofficially

### SIM card registration
Are there requirements to register SIM cards and other communications registration
requirements? Is biometrics involved?

### Sectoral initiatives
The purpose of this section is to explore in more detail the issues with regard to privacy and
data protection in areas that are relevant to life in the and emerging in each country. This
could be related to government schemes launched with lots of publicity; initiatives
introduced without broad public knowledge; schemes in the public or private sector; or de
facto examples in which privacy-related issues have emerged. Not all of these sectors will
be of relevance to every country, and so select which seem like relevant or important
issues. The level of detail we provide for each will vary as well as so we may want to
prioritise those more relevant/important now, and provide more details in the future.

For these sectors, it is most important to get across why these are relevant from a privacy
or data protection perspective. It may be important to understand:

a) the legal backdrop, or lack of, to a scheme

b) whether it is a private and/or public sector initiative; for public sector initiatives, which government agencies/bodies are involved, and for private sector, which companies are involved, and who is involved in the financing;

c) whether databases and information are stored locally or internationally; is information
held securely?

d) do the databases involved links with other sources of information, eg via a national ID
project

e) the extent to which it has been introduced - whether it's a national scheme, a pilot, oronly covers a limited sector of the population

f) whether there are concerns the scheme is discriminatory, or prejudicial, in how it is
deployed/used

### Cyber Security Policy
Does the country have a cyber security policy? Which government agency is developing it?
Are there any external actors involved (OAS, AU, EU, US?) What provisions does it contain?
Is it enforced?

### Cybercrime
Are there laws/legal provisions addressing cyber crimes? If yes, Under
which government ministry/agency does it fall (military, defence, law
enforcement?). Do these contain provisions allowing access and collection of data by law
enforcement/authorized authorities?

### Encryption
Are there limitations to what techniques people can lawfully use to
protect themselves? Eg is encryption regulated (need to register for use) or banned?

### Licensing of industry
What obligations are imposed on the telecommunication industry under
licensing agreements, these may include: modification of networks, providing direct access,
enabling decryption of encrypted communications, etc.

### E-governance/digital agenda
Is the government promoting an "e-governance" agenda? This could include, for example,
making access to government information and services through an online portal.
- Does the egoverment programme hamper access for anyone who is not able to access
services online, for example making some services available ONLY through the
egovernment platform?
- Does the egovernment platform use SSL/HTTPS?
- Do these services require a unique identifier as a login (for example, a
national ID card number)? Is there an associated database that links the
user's access to services?
- Have any privacy concerns been raised over the egovernment programme?
- Are national data protection or privacy standards applicable to the government?
	
### Health sector + e-health
This is the use of databases and identity cards and how it ties to the health sector. What
new initiatives have been started, and what are planned, that gather data? How is data
stored and shared, and does it have an impact beyond that intended? For example, do
citizens need to be registered to access health care?
	
### Smart policing
Smart policing is:
- Predictive policing: The use of technology that 'predicts' where crime hotspots are going
to be
- Integrated policing: the use of vastly increased databases and sources of information for
police
	
### Transport
The use of systems like smart cards for transport (eg the Oyster card in London)
	
### Smart Cities
Initiatives surrounding "smart cities" - this is the collection of large amounts of data in an
urban environment (for example, traffic patterns, rubbish collections, energy usage), often
under the discourse of trying to make cities more efficient or "modern".
	
### Migration
This is issues relating to migration, including biometric passports, biometrics visas and
registration of refugees, and management of delivery of services in refugee camps.
	
### Emergency Response
These are issues surrounding emergencies and responses - for example, following
earthquakes or infectious disease outbreaks. This could highlight the tension between
public emergency and privacy.
Humanitarian and development programmes
This is the use of technologies surrounding humanitarian and development programmes,
for example initiatives to manage access to social/welfare services (food banks/collection
points, m-transfers, etc.) It could explore what types of data are collected, how and where
the data is stored, and how it's used. 	
  
### Social media
These are issues surrounding social media in the country, for example a popular website
that has suffered a leak or data breaches. Other issues might include the use of social
media for policing purposes, and privacy and security concerns of social media user
